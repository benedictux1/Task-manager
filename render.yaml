# Render Blueprint: ensures the frontend (Vite) is built so the server can serve the latest UI
services:
  - type: web
    name: task-manager
    runtime: node
    # Build from repo root so both frontend and server are built
    buildCommand: npm run build:render
    startCommand: npm start
    # Server runs from root and "npm start" does "cd server && npm start"
    # Static files are served from ./dist (created by "npm run build" inside build:render)
